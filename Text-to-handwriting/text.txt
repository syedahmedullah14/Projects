10) What are the bases of segmenting segmenting markets
The four bases for segmenting consumer market are as follows:  
1. Demographic Segmentation:
Demographic segmentation divides the markets into groups based on  variables such as age, gender, family size, income, occupation,  education, religion, race and nationality. Demographic factors are the  most popular bases for segmenting the consumer group. One reason is that  consumer needs, wants, and usage rates often vary closely with the  demographic variables.
2. Geographic Segmentation: 
Geographic segmentation refers to dividing a market into different geographical units such as nations, states, regions, cities, or neighbourhoods. For example, national newspapers are published and distrib­uted to different cities in different languages to cater to the needs of the consumers. 
3. Psychographic Segmentation:
Psychographic segmentation pertains to lifestyle and personality traits.  In the case of certain products, buying behaviour predominantly depends  on lifestyle and personality characteristics.
